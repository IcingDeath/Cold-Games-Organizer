# Cold-Games-Organizer
The Issue Tracker Repository for my Games Organizer App

The app can be downloaded over at https://coldgamesorg.de/

The current version is build on .Net 5.0 and WPF, so it should run on anything from Windows 7 and newer

If you want to try it out and find a bug or have a suggestion, you can open an issue on this github, I will have a look at it.

You can alternatively contact me on Twitter, my app specific account is https://twitter.com/ColdGamesOrg and my main personal account is https://twitter.com/ColdDeath
